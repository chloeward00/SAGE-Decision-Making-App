## SECTION B

> Guidance: This document is expected to be approximately 3 pages in length, but it can exceed this page limit.
> It is also permissible to carry forward content from this proposal to your later documents (e.g. functional
> specification) as appropriate.
>
> Your proposal must include *at least* the following sections.


### Introduction

> Application that will behave as a decision maker. It will help groups
> of people and to organise plans with no hassle. SAGE will provide
> users choices they can pick from depending on the categories they
> choose such as places to eat, activities to do, and movies to watch.
> It will create a 'decision' based on the group of users\' choices.
> Aside from this, SAGE will also take into account the weather and
> user's availability. SAGE aims to ultimately shorten and simplify the
> decision making process of groups.

### Outline

> Users will need to register with a valid email address along with
> other details such as First Name, Last Name, and Password prior to
> signing up to the application. Users will have the ability to also
> reset their password and delete their account. Users can have multiple
> groups within the application. Users can be added to groups and input
> the dates that they are available.

### Background

> In this progressive web application, a user will create a plan. All
> members in a group will be asked for their availability dates using a
> calendar provided by SAGE. It will provide the group members with the
> dates that the majority is available. SAGE will have features which
> will show activities near you, access to a wide range of movies or
> places that you may want to eat at. It will have a swipe feature which
> will allow a user to swipe right for 'yes' and swipe left for 'no'.
> The most picked choice will be shown to all users in the group.
>
> We have a wide range of features that we wish to implement for this
> web application but it all depends on how much time we have left after
> implementing the core functionalities of the application.

### Achievements

> The application will provide users with the functionality of making
> decisions fast with friends and family in an efficient manner. The
> application will provide the end users with activities that are
> dependent on the current day\'s weather, access to movies to choose
> from, and restaurants available in the area. The scope of users for
> the application can be anyone that
>
> has access to a mobile device or laptop, as it is a progressive web
> application so we plan for it to work on different browsers and a wide
> range of devices.


### Justification

> The web application will be useful for the end users as they will be
> able to come to decisions with friends which will allow them to be
> efficient and make a decision with friends who all mutually agree.
>
> The application will be useful when users can't come to an agreement
> because based on our personal experience it is difficult to organise a
> plan that everyone agrees on. This application will work as a way to
> get rid of that barrier and provide a plan that all users agree on so
> it will be highly useful in that aspect as the users will be able to
> make plans and view what each user matched on.


### Programming language(s)


> ●  Python         
> ●  Nodejs         
> ●  Nosql database 
> ●  Nextjs         
> ●  React          
> ●  JavaScript   

### Programming tools / Tech stack

> Firebase Realtime database
> Nosql database that will let us sync data between users in real time
> Firebase Cloud Firestore - Nosql database - that will let us store, sync and query data for our progressive web application
> Firebase Cloud Storage - This allows users to upload and share user-generated content within the application.
> Firebase Authentication - This provides methods for users to create an account and to manage their email address and passwords. It also manages user authentication and verification.
> CSS Frameworks Such as Bulma and Bootstrap
> IMDb-API - is a web service for receiving movie, serial and cast information
> Weather API - A weather app API to access weather information to determine activities 
> Jest Testing - Open source testing framework built on JavaScript for integration tests.
> Material UI - Open source for designing React components


### Hardware

> Describe any non-standard hardware components which will be required.

### Learning Challenges

> One of the team members will be new to NextJs so Chloe will have to devote time to learning that language.                                       |
> One of the team members will be new to NextJs so Chloe will have to devote time to learning that language.
> We will have to successfully tie both the front and back end together.
> We will have to create an algorithm for the web application that will allow us to successfully monitor matched decisions.
> Understanding the tools and languages to be used in order to apply them properly to the project.
> Creating a progressive web application that is fully functional on and mobile devices.
> Finding a suitable database to store the web applications data.

### Breakdown of work

> Chloe will be in charge of the back-end development by deciding what
> algorithms / data structures to use. Chloe will focus on the backend
> development of the web application.
>
> Joanna will be in charge of the front-end development by determining
> the structure and design of the application, and balancing between
> functional and aesthetic design.
>
> However, both will be working together concurrently on both aspects of
> front-end and back-end. They will have to distinguish what needs to be
> done for the application features to be created. Both will also decide
> what tools will be implemented for our application to work.
